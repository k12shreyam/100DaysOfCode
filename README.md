# 100DaysofCode

I choose to commit to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, my goals for this challenge are that I improve my overall skillset in C++,OOPs,SQL and Data Structure & Algorithms.
Furthermore I want to get into the habit of coding everyday for a certain amount of time, so I hope that this challenge will help me with this.

## Rules
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
3. Push code everyday to this repository.
